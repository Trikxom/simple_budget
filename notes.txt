# Major tasks
    * Add animations with jQuery to make the app seem more responsive

# Minor tasks

# Current task
    * Put focus on item_text when adding a new budget_item

# Things to remember
    * There should always be one budget item so the fact that the first
      one can't be deleted makes sense. It might look less weird when the
      page gets styled -> i.e. Style accordingly.
