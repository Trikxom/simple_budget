# Major tasks
    * Add local storage support
    * Add CSS

# Minor tasks
    * Add start new budget button which deletes all budget items and clears
      the total. Prompt for confirmation first obviously.

# Current task

# Things to remember
    * There should always be one budget item so the fact that the first
      one can't be deleted makes sense. It might look less weird when the
      page gets styled -> i.e. Style accordingly.
