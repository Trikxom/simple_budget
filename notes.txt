# Minor tasks
    * Fix global scope reference issues - using jQuery.
    * Add clear button to first budget item since it cannot be deleted.
    * Scroll to top when about button is clicked or come up with better
      popup implementation so scrolling is not required.

# Current task

# Things to remember
    * There should always be one budget item so the fact that the first
      one can't be deleted makes sense. It might look less weird when the
      page gets styled -> i.e. Style accordingly.
    * When adding in jQuery, start by just just using it for selecting
      elements. Then work on using some built-in methods for event handling.
