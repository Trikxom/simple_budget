# Simple Budget

**A Javascript powered app which allows you to create simple budgets quickly and easily.**

* You can create budget items with a short textual description.
* Your budget is stored locally so you can see it again later.
* The adaptive layout means it looks great on large desktop screens and tiny mobile screens.

Simple Budget works great on all mobile devices but it is iPhone app-capable which means
you can add it to your home screen from Safari and have it act like a native app. It even
uses HTML 5 caching so you don't need an Internet connection to use the app.

Your budget gets saved locally everytime you hit the re-calculate total button. It uses
HTML 5 localStorage where available but can use cookies if necessary.
