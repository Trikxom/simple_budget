    * Allow the first item to be deleted. Instead of having a special first item
      make all items delete-able but when the users tries to delete the last item
      (leaving no remaining items) instead of deleting it, just clear it. Or start
      a new budget.

# Things to remember
    * There should always be one budget item so the fact that the first
      one can't be deleted makes sense. It might look less weird when the
      page gets styled -> i.e. Style accordingly.
