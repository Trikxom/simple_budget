# Major tasks
    * Add animations with jQuery to make the app seem more responsive

# Minor tasks
    * Add clear button to first budget item since it cannot be deleted.
    * Add localStorage support -> look into totalStorage.
    * Make the about->close button trigger the clicke even for about
      this would allow toggle event handlers to be used. Do the same
      for the new budget popup.

# Current task

# Things to remember
    * There should always be one budget item so the fact that the first
      one can't be deleted makes sense. It might look less weird when the
      page gets styled -> i.e. Style accordingly.
